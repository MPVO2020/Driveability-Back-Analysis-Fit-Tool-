This Driveability Back-Analysis Fit Function tool runs via Jupyter
Notebook file (.ipynb).

The Notebook runs the large_runfunc.py which prepares and makes some alterations
to the BE, BA and ID data. 

The Notebook then runs the eval_R_MSE function to calculate the
RMSE at individual locations.

The notebook loops through the cases and then the locations.

Documentation is provided in the Notebook and .py files.
